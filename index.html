      Star Platinum (スタープラチナ（星の白金） Sutā Purachina) is the Stand of Jotaro Kujo, primarily featured in the third part of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, Stardust Crusaders. It also appears in the fourth part, Diamond is Unbreakable, and the sixth part, Stone Ocean.

Star Platinum is a close-range Stand with exceptional strength and speed, as well as gaining the ability to stop time during the fight against DIO. Its overwhelming power, coupled with Jotaro's fighting prowess, make it one of the strongest and most iconic Stands in the series.

      Star Platinum is a humanoid Stand, resembling a tall, well-built man of similar proportions to Jotaro, if not more muscular. In colored art, its skin is often a hue between purple, blue, green, and small bits of gold. Its face and body have varying colors.

It has long, flowing hair with a darker shade above its eyes and on the bridge of its nose, blurring the distinction between its hair and head. The spaces under its eyes and on its cheeks and chin are a darker color and divided clearly from the space around its nose and mouth. It wears a cap on its chin, and a metallic headband in three pieces, the central piece of which is shaped as a vertical ellipse. Initially, its facial features were very similar to Jotaro's.

A wavy line runs from each arm to the front of its torso, continuing down its legs. It has a minimal range of clothing and armor, including a short, circular scarf, shoulder pads with a spiral design, long gloves with studs on the back, knee and elbow guards, a loincloth, and short boots (which became knee-length as of Part 6). Earlier depictions in the manga had Star Platinum wearing pants underneath its loincloth, and the Stardust Crusaders OVA keeps this design aspect throughout.

Star Platinum was designed to look like a guardian spirit. Its shoulder pads resemble the ones worn in Fist of the North Star. The spiral patterns symbolize the Ripple and the concept of infinity.[3]

        Abilities
      </h2>
      As one of the most powerful Stands featured in the series, Star Platinum has an overwhelming physical prowess in every basic characteristic, save for range. Coupled with Jotaro's own cleverness in combat, the Stand is capable of defeating most Stand users without the use of any complex abilities. In addition, Jotaro's eventual discovery of its true potential only makes it all the more formidable in combat.

Super Strength: Star Platinum possesses immense strength, being able to throw a Jeep carrying four men and a girl out of the path of an 18-wheeler with one hand, later pulling the same Jeep out of a canyon with only a car as a counter-weight,[6] and destroy large artificial diamonds within seconds.[7] This same strength allows it to launch itself and its user into the air to clear long distances.
Super Speed: Star Platinum boasts phenomenal speed. It was able to intercept a bullet fired from point-blank range,[4] briefly contended with Silver Chariot (whilst it was using Anubis),[8] and is stated to exceed the speed of light.[9]
Precision: Star Platinum is incredibly precise; it can surgically remove an object embedded in a person's skull without ill effect, catch both a bullet and a minuscule Stand like Lovers between his thumb and forefinger in midair, and create a near photo-realistic drawing of a small Egyptian fly from a dark, blurry photo.[1]
Enhanced Eyesight: Star Platinum utilizes eagle-like eyesight throughout Stardust Crusaders. Jotaro has used Star Platinum's eyes to see four kilometers across a desert,[10] as well as identify meaningful details, such as a specific type of fly in high-resolution images.[1] It can also follow a card shuffle performed by a professional gambler, subsequently recounting the entire new order of the deck.
Enhanced Breath: Star Platinum inhales with superhuman lung capacity, capable of sucking in the entire fog Stand Justice and holding it long enough for its user to suffocate.[11]
Enhanced Durability: Star Platinum's defense allows it to defend its user from various attacks such as Hierophant Green's Emerald Splash or The World's strikes. It is also able to minimize environmental damage when Jotaro is sent flying through objects.
